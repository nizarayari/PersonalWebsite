    content:'<strong>I worked directly with Nizar</strong>. His dedication is relentless even when deadlines were challenging and very tight. He continued to deliver very good work on time and always wants to go above and beyond what was requested of him.  This, coupled with his extreme attention to detail in technical issues makes him one of the few strong members at Gigster. I would definitely recommend Nizar to organizations seeking someone who is ready to come onboard and immediately begin contributing to the greater good.',
