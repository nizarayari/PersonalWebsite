Throughout the project he continued to deliver good work and always wants to go above and beyond what was requested of him.  His problem solving skills made him a strong member of the Gigster development community. I was encouraged to see how fast Nizar picked up new concepts. I would recommend Nizar to organizations seeking someone who is ready to come onboard and immediately begin contributing to their development efforts.',
