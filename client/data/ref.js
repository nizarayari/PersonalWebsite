    content:'I worked with Nizar Ayari directly on Say Partie project. He delivered all milestones on time and always wants to go above and beyond for each of them.  This, coupled with his extreme attention to detail in technical issues makes him one of the few strong members of Gigster. He is a “hard worker” and “team player”. I was encouraged to see how fast he picks up concepts and furthermore he would often offer up opinions and suggestions on app performance improvements. I would definitely recommend Nizar to organizations seeking someone who is ready to come onboard and immediately begin contributing to the greater good.',
